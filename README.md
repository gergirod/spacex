# spacex

Build with __Kotlin__, applying **SOLID** principles and using the **Clean Architecture** approach that allows you to decouple the app with layers (presentation, domain, data), making the code easier to understand, modify and test.
I also implement the **Model View ViewModel** design pattern, to isolate the UI from the business logic. Additionally, I used **coroutines** for Asynchronous tasks, **Retrofit** and **Okhttp3** to get data from https://api.spacexdata.com/v3 api, **Material Components** for the "design" and user experience of the app, **Coil** library for image loading and **Koin** for dependency injection.
